Using data generated by Rocket League, transferred via BakkesMod and uploaded to BallChasing.com, generate a sortable, filterable dataset of Rocket League statistics.

Elements of interest to capture include:
 - Player name
 - Player rank
 - Game mode (e.g. 2v2, 3v3)
 - Ranked/unranked
 - Team result (win/loss)
 - Team score
 - Player score
 - Player goals
 - Player assists
 - Player saves
 - Player shots
 
Future versions may capture team stats (e.g. possession), game duration, speed, positioning, boost, demo and powerslide statistics.
